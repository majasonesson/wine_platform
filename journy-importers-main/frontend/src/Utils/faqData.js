    question: 'What is Journy?',
    answer:
      "Journy is a platform for wine producers that brings your wine's story to life. It lets you share every step of your journey—from vineyard to table—with customers who care about quality, sustainability, and authenticity. Our E-labels helps you build trust, showcase your values, and connect with customers who appreciate the passion behind every bottle.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do E-labels work?',
    answer:
      "E-labels are QR codes on your wine bottles that tell your story. When someone scans the code with their phone, they can see details about your wine—like where it's made, how it's produced, and your commitment to quality and sustainability. It's a simple way to connect with customers and build trust.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How many e-labels will I need?',
    answer: `Our plans are based on the total number of e-labels you need across all your wines, not just per year. Here's how it works:<br/><br/>
    • 2025: If you release 10 new wines, you'll need 10 e-labels. You can start with our 15 e-label plan at €179/year.<br/><br/>
    • 2026: When you release another 15 wines, plus the 10 from 2025, you'll need 25 e-labels. You'll then upgrade to the 30 or 50 e-label plan, with pricing from €319 to €479/year, depending on your needs.`,

  {
    question: 'Once I print the QR codes, can I edit the information?',
    answer:
      "Yes, you can! After printing the QR codes with basic details like the name, vintage, and variety, you can always come back to update or add more information, such as ingredients or nutritional details. Since it's all digital, there's no need to reprint anything when you make changes!",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you calculate the energy content?',
    answer:
      "Yes, we take care of that for you! Just enter the alcohol percentage, sugar levels, and organic acids, and we'll automatically calculate the energy content based on EU standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't follow the regulation?",
    answer:
      'As of December 8, 2023, the EU regulation mandates that all wines produced and sold must have the correct label. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to €40,000.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of technology is Journy using?',
    answer: `Journy uses blockchain and QR codes to make your wine's journey transparent and secure.<br/><br/>Blockchain: It's like a digital record that logs every step of your wine's production. Once added, the information can't be changed by anyone outside your trusted network, preventing counterfeiting. You can still update details or fix errors whenever needed, keeping everything accurate.<br/><br/>QR Codes: The QR code on your bottle links to a smart E-label, allowing customers to instantly access detailed information about your wine, making it easy to connect them to your product's story.`,
